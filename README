Before you start the bot you need to download the skype-sdk.tar.gz 
package to the directory and then install the dependencies using 
`npm install`.

Make sure you defined you environment variables BOT_ID, APP_ID and APP_SECRET and 
that they contain your bot's id and MSA OAuth credentials.

You can start the bot with `node echo.js`. By default the server will
be listening on port 8080.
